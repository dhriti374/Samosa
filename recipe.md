Steps to make samosas:

1) Prepare the masala for potato filling
Put a pan on the heat and add 2 tsp oil.Once the oil is hot enough,
add cumin seeds and allow them to crackle.

2) Add spices and boiled potatoes and cook for a while
Now add coriander seeds, ginger and green chilli.Saute for a minute
and then add chopped cashews and raisins, peanuts if u like them,
boiled and mushed potatoes, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam
masala powder, red chilli powder, salt to taste, kasoori methi leaves,
coriander leaves.Mix well and saute for 2 minutes. Stuffing is ready.

3) Prepare the dough for the samosa
Take a mixing bowl and combine all purpose flour along with carom seeds
and salt. Mix and then add ghee and start kneading by adding a little 
water at a time. Ensure that you add water gradually and make a firm
dough. A soft dough will not make your samosas crispy. Cover the dough with a damp muslin cloth and keep aside for half an hour.

4) Roll the dough in small puris and cut into half
Poll out a few samll sized balls from the dough. Flatten them further 
with the help of your palms and a rolling pin. Give them a round shape 
and cut in half. Now dip your ahnds in water, fold the edges of the semi circle in order to give a cone shape.

5) Fill the semi circle with potato filling and deep fry
Seal the ends properly by pressing the edges lightly with your fingers.
Heat oil in a pan and deep fry golden browen and crispy samosas. Serve
with tomato ketchup or green coriander chutney. Enjoy it.
